\chapter{Motivation - why databinding}\label{chap:motivatio}

The first question, as always should be, is the motivation of this work. 
What is the motivation to create another library, that will handle databinding in dart?

We will start with small introduction to the history of how websites and later web-applications were created. 
Then we define a set of features required for \textbf{tiles}.

\section{History}\label{sec:history}
\subsection{Plain documents}\label{subsec:history-plain-doc}
\subsection{Simple PHP}\label{subsec:history-server-side-scripts}
\subsection{Server side frameworks}\label{subsec:history-server-side-frameworks}
\subsection{Simple JavaScript/jQuery}\label{subsec:history-jquery}
\subsection{JavaScript MVC frameworks}\label{subsec:history-js-mvc}


\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives}

From previous overview of "history" we can produce a set of the features, 
which should be contained in \textbf{tiles}.

\subsection{Server-side rendering}\label{subsec:objectives-server-side-rendering}
\subsection{Programmer friendly API}\label{subsec:objectives-friendly-api}
\subsection{Easy concept}\label{subsec:objectives-easy-concept}
\subsection{Two way databinding}\label{subsec:objectives-two-way-databinding}
