\chapter{Benchmarks}\label{chap:benchmarks}

We created the \tiles library because our port of the \react into the Dart language was slow. 
Natural question arises. Is the \tiles library faster then the \react port into the dart?

\textit{
	We don't compare the \react library with the \tiles library, we compare the port of it into the dart. 
	The main problem in the port performance was the communication between the JavaScript \react library and the implementation created in the Dart language.
}

We measured the time of several distinct scenarios:
\begin{description}
	\item[The mass vs. the structure] \hfill \\
		We will measure the time, needed to render the mass of components in the same level, 
		and to render the complicated structure with lot of branching.
	\item[Creating of the virutal DOM vs. rendering into the real one] \hfill \\
		We measured the time of the construction of the virtual DOM and the render it into the real one. 
		The measurement is compared between the port and the \tiles library.
	\item[Clean vs. dirty updates] \hfill \\
		The last measurement is the comparison of the duration of the updates. 
		We distinguish two types of updates, clean without any change in the virtual DOM and dirty which changes the virtual DOM.
\end{description}
